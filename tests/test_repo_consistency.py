"""Repo-wide consistency guards -- "the CI that would have caught all of
this" for the hooks-reliability effort.

None of these tests exercise a single hook's logic (test_hooks.py does
that) or a single fixture tree (test_real_projects.py does that). They
instead lock relationships BETWEEN files that nothing else checks: a data
file hand-mirrored into a test table, a command a hook prints to the user
that has to actually run, a safety net every hook script is expected to
have, and documentation that must not quietly start overpromising again.
Every one of these is a class of defect this project has already shipped
once with all other tests green -- see the task-12 report for the mutation
that proves each check actually fails when the consistency it guards is
broken.

Run with:  python3 tests/test_repo_consistency.py

Standard library only (plus `bash` on PATH for the shell-syntax check,
which is skipped -- not failed -- when bash is unavailable).

# 1. Architecture catalog vs. the STACKS table in test_real_projects.py
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# references/architecture-catalog.md is prose + a data file: for each stack
# it documents `allowed_paths` and the reasoning behind every entry.
# tests/test_real_projects.py keeps a STACKS dict that is, by its own
# comment, a hand-maintained MIRROR of that same data, used to run the real
# Rule-5 hook against real fixture trees. Nothing enforces that the mirror
# stays a mirror: edit one `allowed_paths` line in the catalog (the
# reasoning-carrying, human-edited source) without touching the other, and
# every existing suite stays green -- test_real_projects.py would keep
# testing the OLD list forever, silently decoupled from the doc a human
# reads to understand what's allowed. This is the exact failure class the
# brief calls out as the most valuable check in this file.
