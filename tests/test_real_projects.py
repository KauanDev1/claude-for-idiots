"""Every file a real project of each stack legitimately contains must be
allowed by the Rule 5 hook.

Why this exists: every OTHER test in this suite builds an imaginary tree in
a tempdir. None of them ever ran the hook against what a real scaffold
(`create-next-app`, `nest new`, `flutter create`, ...) actually produces, so
a catalog `allowed_paths` list could look reasonable and still block most of
a real project without any test noticing. An audit of
`references/architecture-catalog.md` against real project layouts found 42
of 63 real files denied -- including `app/page.tsx` for Next.js (App Router
without `--src-dir` is the default), `main.py` for FastAPI, and
`integration_test/` for Flutter (Flutter's own official integration-test
directory, blocked by the same skill's Rule 2 that requires it).

Run with:  python3 tests/test_real_projects.py

Methodology note -- why this does NOT just stat the checked-in fixture
files in place: Rule 5 only polices file *placement*, not edits. The hook
short-circuits to allow whenever `os.path.exists(cwd/rel)` is already true
("an existing file is an edit, not a placement" -- see
`hooks/enforce_architecture.py`). Fixture files are checked into git, so
they always exist on disk; testing them in place would make every case
here vacuously pass no matter what `allowed_paths` said. To actually
exercise the contract, each fixture is copied into a scratch directory and,
for every file, that ONE file is deleted immediately before invoking the
hook (then restored) -- reproducing "the agent is about to create this file
here" instead of "this file is already here."
